What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications. It provides a package of tools that work consistently across all machines, helping developers achieve consistency in the development and deployment process.

Difference Between Container and Virtual Machine

Container: An isolated environment for running an application that shares the host OS kernel, making it lightweight and efficient.

Virtual Machine: An abstraction of a physical machine, including the entire OS, which consumes more resources compared to containers.

Docker Architecture

Docker follows a client-server architecture where:

Docker Client: The user interacts with the Docker client to issue commands.

Docker Daemon: The server (daemon) handles tasks such as creating, starting, and stopping containers.

Images: Read-only templates for creating containers, stored in registries (e.g., Docker Hub).

Containers: Lightweight, isolated environments that run applications using the host OS kernel.

Docker Image

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

Example:

nginx:latest contains the Nginx web server and its dependencies.

Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, adds files, sets environment variables, and specifies commands to run.

Example Dockerfile:

FROM ubuntu:20.04
COPY . /app
RUN make /app
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]

This Dockerfile creates an image starting from Ubuntu, copies files, runs a build command, and sets the default command to run the app.

Basic Linux

Linux Distribution

A Linux distribution (or "distro") is a version of the Linux operating system packaged with software, tools, and a desktop environment. Different distros serve different needs, such as ease of use, security, or customization.

Popular Examples:

Ubuntu: User-friendly and popular for development.

Fedora: Known for its cutting-edge software.

Debian: Stable and widely used.

Simple Linux Shell Commands

echo hello: Prints "hello".

whoami: Displays the current user.

echo $0: Prints the name of the script or shell being executed.

pwd: Prints the working directory.

ls: Lists the files and directories.

cd: Changes the directory.

Example: cd ~ navigates to the home directory.

mkdir folderName: Creates a directory.

mv oldName newName: Renames or moves a file/directory.

touch fileName.txt: Creates a file (supports multiple files in one command).

rm fileName: Removes files.

rm -r directoryName: Removes directories.

cat fileName: Displays the contents of a file.

cat file1 file2: Combines and displays both files.

more fileName: Displays large files (scrolling only downward).

less fileName: Similar to more but allows scrolling up and down.

head -n X fileName: Displays the first X lines of a file.

tail -n X fileName: Displays the last X lines of a file.

Copy Files Using cat:

cat file1.txt > file2.txt: Copies content from file1.txt to file2.txt.

cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt: Combines content into a new file.

Redirect Output:

echo hello > hello.txt: Creates hello.txt with "hello" inside.

Search Commands

grep -i searchTerm fileName.txt: Searches for "searchTerm" in the file.

-i: Ignore case sensitivity.

Can search in multiple files by specifying them.

These organized notes provide clarity and better command segmentation for efficient reference.

## Finding files and directories
`find` - that show all the files and directories also the hidden ones tools
`ls -a` - show all hidden files tools
`find /etc` - now it's all the files in etc directory
`find -type d` - show all the directories
`find -type f` - show all the files

## Chainig Commands
for running multiple command at same row we use this `;` here is Example
`mkdir test ; cd test ; echo doen`
but here if we go `cd ..` back and run the smae command it will show error for the first command 
excute the rest but if we use and opperator if the first command filed it will no excute the rest 
`mkdir test && cd test && echo doen`
also we have or operating to render one side if it wounld be true 
`mkdir test || echo 'directory exist'`
if we have long command that we need to scroll horizontally do this 
`mkdir hello;\
`
now go the next line and write the rest
## environment variables
`printev` - to print all the environment variables
`printev PATH` - to see the path of Linux
`echo $PATH` - another way of seeing PATH
`export DB_USER=homayoun` - here is how you cna define the variables but this value is saved in session and if you open another terminal this wound be not show becuase it's only save in session
`echo UB_USER=homayoun >> .bashrc` - now it's append DB_USER to .bashrc

## Manageing Processes
The managing process in Linux involves controlling and monitoring running programs. The ps command lists active processes with details like PID and status. The sleep command pauses a process for a specified time. The kill command terminates a process using its PID.

## Manage Users
`useradd` - for adding user 
`usermod` - for modife the user 
`userdel` - for deleting the user
this users are save in configuration here `/etc/passwd` also password are here `/etc/shadow`

## Managing Group
we have similar command like manage user 
`groupadd`,`groupmod`, `groupdel`
and list groups are saved in `cat /etc/group`
here how add user into group 
`usermod -G groupName userName`
also you can find the exact user in passwd and other file like this 
`grep userName /directory`
here is way to see the user is join in which groups 
`groups userName`

## file premissions
The chmod u+x deploy.sh command in Linux grants the user (owner) of the file deploy.sh the permission to execute it. The u stands for the user, and +x adds the execute permission. This allows the owner to run the script as a program.

# Containers vs Images
In Docker, **images** and **containers** are closely related but serve different purposes:

1. **Images**: These are read-only templates or blueprints that contain the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration needed to run an application. Images are built from Dockerfiles and stored in registries like Docker Hub.

2. **Containers**: These are running instances of Docker images. When you start an image, it becomes a container, which is a lightweight, isolated environment where the application runs. Containers are ephemeral and can be started, stopped, or deleted.

In short, an **image** is the static definition of an application, while a **container** is the dynamic, running instance of that image.

### Dockerfiles commands
- from (base image)
- workdir (working direcotry)
- Copy/And (file transfer)
- run (excute command)
- env (set environment variables)
- expose (open ports)
- user (set user)
- CMD (default command)
- entrypoint (main command)

## Dockerfile order 
you should write the command that change less at the top and those change frequently at the bottom

Prune is a Docker command (docker system prune) that removes unused images, containers, volumes, and networks to free up disk space. It identifies and deletes resources not associated with running containers, ensuring a cleaner and more efficient system.
here are example 
`docker image prune` also `docker container prune`

## Image tag
In Docker, a tag is a label applied to a Docker image to identify a specific version or variant of that image. Tags are typically used to differentiate between different builds, versions, or environments (e.g., latest, v1.0, prod). For example, if you have an image named myapp, you can tag it as myapp:v1.0 for version 1.0 and myapp:latest for the most recent build.

## Save and load Images 
docker save exports an image as a tar file, allowing you to transfer it between systems. docker load imports the saved image back into Docker. Example:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker save -o myimage.tar myimage  
docker load -i myimage.tar  
Use them to move images without needing a registry.

## Containers 
for see list of containers we use 
`docker run ps` : to see list of all containers 
`docker run react-app` : to run image but now we can't do anything on that terminal like npm run dev vite 
`docker run -d react-app` : now is create container that we can work on it to reference this we can use id or name and this render autanmitlcally 
`docker run -d --name container-name react-app` : now generate contianer with custome name

## Viewing the logs
`docker logs idOfContainer` : to see the log and output of continaner
`docker logs -f idOfContainer` : to follow the log
`docker logs -n limiOfLineToShow idOfContainer` : usefull if you have long log
`docker logs -n limiOfLineToShow idOfContainer` : usefull if you have long log
`docker logs -t idOfContainer` : To see the time of each log 

## Publich port 
`docker run -d -p port:port --name nameofContinaer imageName`

## Eexcuting Commands in Running Continaers
`docker exec` : excute command in running container
`docker exec -t continaer-name sh` : show we go to sh of it and we can work on their too 

## Stopping and Starting Continaers
`docker stop container-name` : to stop the running container
`docker start contaienr-name` : to start the contaienr
with docker run we start new contianer but with docker start we start stop container

## Remove Container 
`docker continaer rm name-contianer` or `docker rm name-container` : both remove container but contianer must be stopped
`docker rm -f name-contianer`: now it force and dosen't matter contianer is running or not it will remove it anyway
