## What is the Docker ?

A platform for building , running and shipping applications. packages of tools that
work the same in all machines. Docker help us to build consistently : build , run and ship applications.

## What is the differece between container and Virtual Machine ?

**Container:** An isolated environment for running an application
**Virtual machine:** An abstraction of machine(physical hardware)

## What is the Docker Architecture

Docker architecture is based on a client-server model where the Docker client interacts with the Docker daemon (server) to build, run, and manage containers. The daemon handles tasks like creating, starting, and stopping containers, while images (read-only templates) are stored in a registry (e.g., Docker Hub). Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that run applications using the host OS kernel, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Docker image

A **Docker image** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies). For example, an image like `nginx:latest` contains the Nginx web server and its dependencies.

## Docker File

A **Dockerfile** is a text file that contains instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, adds files, sets environment variables, and specifies commands to run. For example:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
COPY . /app
RUN make /app
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]
```

This Dockerfile creates an image starting from Ubuntu, copies files, runs a build command, and sets the default command to run the app.

# Basic Linux

## Linux distribution

A Linux distribution (or "distro") is a version of the Linux operating system packaged with software, tools, and a desktop environment. Itâ€™s like a ready-to-use version of Linux, designed for different needs, such as ease of use, security, or customization. Popular examples include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.

## Simple linux shell commands
This Docker shell script:

1. `echo hello` - Prints "hello".
2. `whoami` - Displays the current user.
3. `echo $0` - Prints the name of the script or shell being executed.
4. `pwd` - Print work directory 
5.  `ls` - List
6. `cd` - go into specific folder after it but if write `cd ~` it's go into home
7. `mkdir` - it used to create folder after mdkir sepcifie the folder name
8. `mv` - for rename file and folders or moving file to another folder first previus name then new one
9. `touch` - for create new file after it specifie the file with their type also in one command we can create multiple files
10. `rm` - for remove the files also for remove directory you need to write like this `rm -r directoryName`
