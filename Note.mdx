What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications. It provides a package of tools that work consistently across all machines, helping developers achieve consistency in the development and deployment process.

Difference Between Container and Virtual Machine

Container: An isolated environment for running an application that shares the host OS kernel, making it lightweight and efficient.

Virtual Machine: An abstraction of a physical machine, including the entire OS, which consumes more resources compared to containers.

Docker Architecture

Docker follows a client-server architecture where:

Docker Client: The user interacts with the Docker client to issue commands.

Docker Daemon: The server (daemon) handles tasks such as creating, starting, and stopping containers.

Images: Read-only templates for creating containers, stored in registries (e.g., Docker Hub).

Containers: Lightweight, isolated environments that run applications using the host OS kernel.

Docker Image

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

Example:

nginx:latest contains the Nginx web server and its dependencies.

Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, adds files, sets environment variables, and specifies commands to run.

Example Dockerfile:

FROM ubuntu:20.04
COPY . /app
RUN make /app
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]

This Dockerfile creates an image starting from Ubuntu, copies files, runs a build command, and sets the default command to run the app.

Basic Linux

Linux Distribution

A Linux distribution (or "distro") is a version of the Linux operating system packaged with software, tools, and a desktop environment. Different distros serve different needs, such as ease of use, security, or customization.

Popular Examples:

Ubuntu: User-friendly and popular for development.

Fedora: Known for its cutting-edge software.

Debian: Stable and widely used.

Simple Linux Shell Commands

echo hello: Prints "hello".

whoami: Displays the current user.

echo $0: Prints the name of the script or shell being executed.

pwd: Prints the working directory.

ls: Lists the files and directories.

cd: Changes the directory.

Example: cd ~ navigates to the home directory.

mkdir folderName: Creates a directory.

mv oldName newName: Renames or moves a file/directory.

touch fileName.txt: Creates a file (supports multiple files in one command).

rm fileName: Removes files.

rm -r directoryName: Removes directories.

cat fileName: Displays the contents of a file.

cat file1 file2: Combines and displays both files.

more fileName: Displays large files (scrolling only downward).

less fileName: Similar to more but allows scrolling up and down.

head -n X fileName: Displays the first X lines of a file.

tail -n X fileName: Displays the last X lines of a file.

Copy Files Using cat:

cat file1.txt > file2.txt: Copies content from file1.txt to file2.txt.

cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt: Combines content into a new file.

Redirect Output:

echo hello > hello.txt: Creates hello.txt with "hello" inside.

Search Commands

grep -i searchTerm fileName.txt: Searches for "searchTerm" in the file.

-i: Ignore case sensitivity.

Can search in multiple files by specifying them.

These organized notes provide clarity and better command segmentation for efficient reference.

## Finding files and directories
`find` - that show all the files and directories also the hidden ones tools
`ls -a` - show all hidden files tools
`find /etc` - now it's all the files in etc directory
`find -type d` - show all the directories
`find -type f` - show all the files

## Chainig Commands
for running multiple command at same row we use this `;` here is Example
`mkdir test ; cd test ; echo doen`
but here if we go `cd ..` back and run the smae command it will show error for the first command 
excute the rest but if we use and opperator if the first command filed it will no excute the rest 
`mkdir test && cd test && echo doen`
also we have or operating to render one side if it wounld be true 
`mkdir test || echo 'directory exist'`
if we have long command that we need to scroll horizontally do this 
`mkdir hello;\
`
now go the next line and write the rest
