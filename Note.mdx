work the same in all machines. Docker help us to build consistently : build , run and ship applications.

## What is the differece between container and Virtual Machine ?

**Container:** An isolated environment for running an application
**Virtual machine:** An abstraction of machine(physical hardware)

## What is the Docker Architecture

Docker architecture is based on a client-server model where the Docker client interacts with the Docker daemon (server) to build, run, and manage containers. The daemon handles tasks like creating, starting, and stopping containers, while images (read-only templates) are stored in a registry (e.g., Docker Hub). Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that run applications using the host OS kernel, ensuring consistency across different environments.
