This repository contains my structured notes and hands-on examples from the [**Ultimate Docker Course**](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-docker-course) by Mosh Hamedani.

### ðŸ“… Course Timeline

* **Started:** January 28, 2025
* **Completed:** March 10, 2025

### ðŸ“˜ About the Course

This comprehensive course provides a practical, hands-on guide to mastering Docker and containerization technologies. Itâ€™s designed to take learners from the basics to advanced usage, including:

* Understanding core Docker concepts and containerization
* Creating and managing containers
* Building and versioning custom Docker images
* Using Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration
* Managing networks and volumes
* Optimizing containers for performance and scalability
* Troubleshooting real-world Docker issues
* Using Docker Machine for provisioning Docker hosts

### ðŸš€ Why It Matters

Containerization is an essential skill in modern software development and deployment workflows. By completing this course and building this reference repository, Iâ€™ve developed confidence in using Docker to build efficient, reproducible development environments and production-ready container setups. I continue to revisit and update these notes to strengthen and maintain my Docker proficiency.

### ðŸ“¢ Note on Course Access
Due to international sanctions in Iran, I was unable to access the official Code With Mosh platform directly. I obtained the course through a third-party distributor and completed it in full. While I do not have an official certificate, I carefully followed all course content and documented my learning here.

For courses that included hands-on projects, the completed work is available in this repository. For others that were more theory-focused, Iâ€™ve included comprehensive notes, summaries, and all relevant materials as evidence of completion and understanding.
